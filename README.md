# ARIA Toggle Example

## What is this?

This is a template to follow for [my blogpost about ARIA](https://blog.benmyers.dev/aria/). In that blogpost, I introduce how ARIA can influence HTML elements' names, roles, states, and properties exposed to assistive technology.

## How do I use this?

First, pull the repository down locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenDMyers/ARIA_Toggle_Example.git
```

Open up `index.html` in your browser.

Then follow along with [the blogpost](https://blog.benmyers.dev/aria/).

## Show me the finished product!

If you just want to see the finished product, see the [`finished`](https://github.com/BenDMyers/portfolio/tree/finished) branch.

If you'd instead like to see the toggle recreated semantically, go to the [`semantic`](https://github.com/BenDMyers/portfolio/tree/semantic) branch.
